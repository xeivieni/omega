# omega

Final engineering school project in statistics.

This program can be used to calculate all the factors to perform a modelisation on statistics.

There are two ways of using the app : 
- With a .dat file containing all the data from an analysis
- By entering the useful factor directly

##How to use omega : 

- Download or clone the application
- Run projet.py
- Enter the path to the data file or the factors

##Result comprehension :

When done analysing the data, omega generates a pdf and a html result file.
These files contains the same data :
- A table containing all the parameters used to do the calculation
- An histogram representing the set of input data or generated data

##Known issues:

-Still some issues with the histogram display
